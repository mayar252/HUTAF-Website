# React + Vite Project Setup

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to set up and run the React project using Vite.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js, but ensure it's up to date by running `npm install -g npm`.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   
   Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
   Replace `<project-directory>` with the name of the cloned repository.

3. **Install Dependencies**
   
   Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server**
   
   Start the development server with:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the Vite development server and you can view the project in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

5. **Build for Production**
   
   To create a production build, run:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   The build output will be located in the `dist` directory.

6. **Preview the Production Build**
   
   To preview the production build locally, use:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```
   This will serve the contents of the `dist` directory at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Additional Information

- **ESLint Configuration**: The project includes ESLint for code linting. You can expand the configuration by modifying the `.eslintrc` file.
- **TypeScript**: For TypeScript support, consider integrating the [TypeScript template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts).
